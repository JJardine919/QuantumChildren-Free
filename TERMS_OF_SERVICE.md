**THE SYSTEM DOES NOT CONSTITUTE FINANCIAL, INVESTMENT, OR TRADING ADVICE.**

Nothing provided by the System -- including trading signals, indicator values, analysis outputs, or trade executions -- should be construed as a recommendation to buy, sell, or hold any financial instrument. QuantumChildren is not a registered investment advisor, broker-dealer, or financial planner. Users should consult a qualified financial professional before making any investment decisions.

**QuantumChildren is not responsible for any trading losses incurred through the use of this Software.**

- **MetaTrader 5 (MT5)** and its associated brokers
- **Proprietary trading firms** (prop firms) and their evaluation or funded account programs

## 8. Intellectual Property

All intellectual property rights in the System, including but not limited to source code, algorithms, trading strategies, signal generation logic, indicator implementations, documentation, and associated materials, are and shall remain the exclusive property of QuantumChildren.

**Data collection is DISABLED by default.** The System can optionally collect and transmit trading signals, market data, indicator values, and timestamps to the QuantumChildren collection server at `203.161.61.61:8888` for algorithm training and research purposes. This only occurs when the User explicitly enables collection in `MASTER_CONFIG.json`. No personal user data is collected -- only market-related data.

By enabling data collection, the User consents to this data transmission. Collection can be disabled at any time by setting `COLLECTION_SERVER.enabled` to `false` in the config file. See [PRIVACY_POLICY.md](PRIVACY_POLICY.md) for full details on what data is collected, how it is used, and your rights regarding that data.
