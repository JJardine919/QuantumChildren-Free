## What It Does

1. **Reads market data** from MT5 (BTCUSD, XAUUSD, ETHUSD by default)
2. **Compresses the data** to find patterns (entropy analysis)
3. **Detects market regime** (CLEAN = tradeable, VOLATILE = wait)
4. **Generates signals** when confidence is high enough
5. **Sends signals** to the QuantumChildren network (this improves the models)
6. **Executes trades** based on your settings

---

## Configuration

Edit `config.json`:

```json
{
    "symbols": ["BTCUSD", "XAUUSD"],
    "lot_size": 0.01,
    "confidence_threshold": 0.55,
    "max_positions": 3,
    "enable_trading": false
}
```

**Start with `enable_trading: false`** to watch it before going live.

## FAQ

**Is this really free?**
Yes. The value is in the aggregated data, not individual sales.

**Can I modify it?**
Yes. Just don't remove the entropy_collector - that's how the network improves.

**Is my account info collected?**
No. Only signals, entropy values, and trade outcomes. No passwords, no account numbers.

**What if I lose money?**
This is trading. There's risk. Start with demo accounts or small positions.

**How do I know it's getting better?**
