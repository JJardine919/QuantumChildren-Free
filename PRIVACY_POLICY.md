## 1. Introduction

This Privacy Policy explains how the Quantum Children trading system ("Software", "Service") collects, uses, and protects your information. This policy applies to the Software, the website at quantum-children.com, and the signal collection infrastructure.

## 2. Information We Collect

When data collection is enabled, the Software may send:
- Trading signals generated by the system

These identifiers are generated locally on your machine and cannot be linked to your identity.

## 3. How We Use Data

Collected data is used to:
- Improve signal accuracy across the network
- Develop better trading algorithms
- Research market patterns
- Display aggregate network statistics on the website
- Enhance system performance for all users

We do NOT use data for:
- Targeted advertising
- Selling to third parties
- Profiling individual users

## 4. Data Storage and Retention

- Signal data is stored on our collection server
- **Retention period**: Raw signal data is retained for 24 months for model training purposes
- Aggregated statistics (non-identifiable) may be kept indefinitely
- Website account data is retained while your account is active
- You may request deletion at any time (see Section 10)

## 5. Data Sharing

We DO NOT:
- Sell your data to third parties
- Share individual trading data

## 6. Your Control

### 6.1 Disable Data Collection

To disable signal collection, edit `config.json`:
```json
{
    "collection_enabled": false
}
```

The Software will continue to function for trading without sending data to the network.

### 6.2 Data Deletion

To request deletion of your data, contact us (see Section 13). Include your node ID (found in `quantum_data/.node_id`) and the approximate date range of data you want deleted.

## 7. Collection Infrastructure

Signal data is sent to our collection server via HTTPS. The server:
- Receives trading signals, outcomes, and entropy snapshots
- Does not log IP addresses for tracking
- Uses rate limiting to prevent abuse
- Stores data in an encrypted database

- **Ollama (Optional)**: Local LLM, no external data sent

## 9. Security

We implement:
- Minimal data collection (only what's needed)
- Anonymous data transmission (no PII attached)
- Rate limiting on all endpoints
- Input validation on submitted data
- Encrypted storage

However, no system is 100% secure. Use at your own risk.
