# Privacy Policy

**QuantumChildren Trading System**
**https://quantum-children.com**

Effective Date: February 4, 2026
Last Updated: February 8, 2026

## 1. Introduction

This Privacy Policy explains how the QuantumChildren trading system ("the System", "Software") collects, uses, and protects information. This policy applies to the Software, the website at quantum-children.com, and the signal collection infrastructure.

## 2. Data We Collect

### 2.1 Trading and Market Data

The System collects and transmits **market-related data only**. This includes:

- **Trading signals** generated by the System's algorithms
- **Market data** such as price quotes, bid/ask spreads, volume, and order book information
- **Technical indicator values** computed during analysis (e.g., moving averages, oscillators, volatility metrics, compression/entropy analysis results)
- **Timestamps** associated with all collected data points
- **Market regime classifications** and related analytical outputs
- **Trade execution metadata** such as order type, symbol, timeframe, lot size, entry/exit prices, and trade outcomes (win/loss/breakeven, profit/loss amount)

### 2.2 No Personal User Data Is Collected

**The System collects market data only.** We do not collect:

- Your name or personal identification
- Trading account credentials or passwords
- Account balances or equity
- IP addresses for tracking purposes
- Email addresses (unless you create a website account)
- Personal financial information
- Browser fingerprints or tracking cookies

### 2.3 Anonymous Identifiers

Signal data includes a randomly generated node ID (e.g., "QC_0EAE9938E5B0") to track signal performance over time, identify signal patterns, and improve algorithm accuracy. These identifiers are generated locally on your machine and cannot be linked to your identity.

### 2.4 Website Account Data

If you create an account on quantum-children.com, we collect:

- Email address (for authentication)
- Password (hashed, never stored in plaintext)

## 3. How Data Is Transmitted

Collected data is transmitted via **HTTP** to the QuantumChildren collection server at:

```
203.161.61.61:8888
```

Data is sent in structured format by the `entropy_collector.py` module during normal System operation as trading signals are generated and market conditions are evaluated. Collection can be disabled by the user (see Section 6).

## 4. Purpose of Data Collection

All collected data is used exclusively for:

- **Algorithm training and optimization** -- improving the performance and signal accuracy of QuantumChildren trading models across the network
- **Research and development** -- analyzing market patterns, signal accuracy, and strategy effectiveness
- **System monitoring** -- ensuring the System operates correctly and identifying potential issues
- **Historical analysis** -- backtesting and validating trading strategies against recorded data
- **Aggregate network statistics** displayed on the website

Data is **not** sold to third parties, used for targeted advertising, or used to profile individual users.

## 5. Data Retention

- **Raw signal data** is retained for 24 months for model training purposes.
- **Aggregated statistics** (non-identifiable) may be kept indefinitely.
- Website account data is retained while your account is active.
- You may request deletion at any time (see Section 10).

## 6. Your Control -- Data Collection is Opt-In

**Data collection is DISABLED by default.** No data is sent to the collection server unless you explicitly enable it.

To enable signal collection, edit `MASTER_CONFIG.json`:

```json
{
    "COLLECTION_SERVER": {
        "url": "http://203.161.61.61:8888",
        "enabled": true
    }
}
```

To disable it again, set `"enabled": false`. The Software will continue to function for trading without sending data to the collection server.

## 7. Data Security

We implement:

- Minimal data collection (only what is needed)
- Anonymous data transmission (no PII attached)
- Rate limiting on all endpoints
- Input validation on submitted data
- Encrypted storage

However, no method of electronic transmission or storage is completely secure. We cannot guarantee absolute security of data in transit or at rest. Use at your own risk.

## 8. Third-Party Services

The System operates in conjunction with third-party platforms, including:

- **MetaTrader 5 (MT5)**: Subject to MetaQuotes privacy policy
- **Your Broker**: Subject to your broker's privacy policy
- **Proprietary trading firms**: Subject to each firm's privacy policy
- **Base44** (website hosting): Subject to Base44's privacy policy
- **Usercentrics** (cookie consent on website): Subject to Usercentrics privacy policy
- **Ollama (Optional)**: Local LLM, no external data sent

This Privacy Policy covers only the data practices of the QuantumChildren System itself. Users should consult the privacy policies of any third-party platforms they use in conjunction with the System.

## 9. Data Sharing

We **do not**:

- Sell your data to third parties
- Share individual trading data
- Provide data to marketing companies or advertisers

We **may** share:

- Aggregated, anonymized statistics (e.g., "3,255 total signals collected")
- Research findings without any identifiable data
